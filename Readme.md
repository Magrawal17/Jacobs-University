This is a repository containing all my coursework that I have done in Jacobs University. I have done my best to keep all the solutions which have gotten full marks. Please only Use this a reference to do your coursework and I do not endorse any sort of copying from it.

# Small Request 

Over the year, this repository has gotten a lot more famous and grown a lot, and I hope it has helped everyone in their journey here at Jacobs University. One small favor which I would be grateful for is if you could take some time and connect with me on LinkedIn and feel free to endorse me on any skill you think I might be good at. It would mean a lot to me.

Additionally, I'm always there in the future if you want any advice or tips. Feel free to message me and best of luck.
